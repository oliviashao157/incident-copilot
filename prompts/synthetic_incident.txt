Generate a realistic incident report for a software system.

Category: {category}

Requirements:
- Create a realistic incident title (1 line, specific and actionable)
- Create a detailed description (2-4 paragraphs) including:
  - What happened
  - When it started
  - Impact on users/systems
  - Initial observations and error messages
- Create a resolution description (1-2 paragraphs) with:
  - Root cause analysis
  - Steps taken to resolve
  - Preventive measures implemented

Output as JSON with these exact fields:
{{
    "title": "Brief, specific incident title",
    "description": "Detailed multi-paragraph description",
    "resolution": "Root cause and resolution steps",
    "severity": "critical|high|medium|low"
}}

Guidelines:
- Be specific with service names, metrics, and technical details
- Include realistic timestamps and duration estimates
- Reference specific technologies (Kubernetes, PostgreSQL, Redis, etc.)
- Make it sound like a real incident from a production system
- Include realistic metric values (latency in ms, error rates, affected users)
